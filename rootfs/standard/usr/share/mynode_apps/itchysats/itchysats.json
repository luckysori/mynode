                "After logging in, you will see Itchysats' trading view. The application is pre-configured to connect to a maker who continuously publishes BTCUSD and ETHUSD offers. Before you start trading you will have to fund the app's wallet. The keys stay with you and funds can be withdrawn at any time by navigating to the wallet page.",
                "With coins in your wallet you are ready to open a position. Do you think the price of Bitcoin will go up? It's time open a long BTCUSD position! You will be able to close this position at any point, provided the maker you are connected to is online. If they are not, you are still protected by the DLC protocol and will be able to settle your position within 24 hours according to the outcome of the oracle. You can learn more about the protocol here: https://comit.network/blog/2022/01/11/cfd-protocol-explained/",
                "There are two things that you must consider before you open a position. Firstly, this is beta software and we are still ironing out bugs and adding new features that can cause instability. Secondly, CFD trading is inherently risky. Be sure to read up on the topic before give it a go. Or even better: try it on testnet!"
